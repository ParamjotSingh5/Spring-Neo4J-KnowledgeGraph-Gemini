## Project Title
A Learning Project for Java Spring AI with Neo4J and OpenAI

### Description
This project serves as a hands-on practice to reinforce the skills learned in the "Java Spring AI, Neo4J, and OpenAI for Knowledge Graph RAG" course. It focuses on integrating Java Spring with AI capabilities, utilizing Neo4J as a graph database, and leveraging Gemini's tools for intelligent data processing.

### Technologies Used
- Java Spring: For building the backend application.
- Neo4J: For managing and querying graph data.
- Gemini API: To implement AI-driven functionalities.
- Gradle build tool

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`

### Setup Neo4J.
Start the Neo4J server with docker-compose with script named [docker-compose-neo4j.yml](https://github.com/ParamjotSingh5/Spring-Neo4J-KnowledgeGraph-Gemini/blob/master/src/main/resources/scripts/docker-compose-neo4j.yml)

### Configure Application Properties:
Update application.properties in the Spring project with your Neo4J connection details and put Gemini's API key into environment.
